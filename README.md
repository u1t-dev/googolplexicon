# googolplexicon
numbers galore.

yes, yes – i'm alive

in my absence, i've created a system to name extremely large numbers (far greater than googolplex, a fraud of a number because 10^100 % 3 = 1, and 10^100 % 6 = 4, neither of which are 0, which is necessary for a number to really get its own name in the short and long scales)

this project – aptly named "\[the\] Googolplexicon" (since i think it's a better name than "Googology") – provides a tool for you to get the name of an absolutely MASSIVE number!
